# DucatiMonsterDashboard
Arduino project to parse I²C data from a Ducati Monster 696/796/1100 Dashboard. This data is then send via UART to an Nextion Display.

This way the original display of the Ducati Monster 696/796/1100 can be easily replaced and modified.

Description of the I²C data bytes is here:
